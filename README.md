# Hero Realms Health Counter

**[https://slopdotjpg.github.io/hero_realms_counter/](https://slopdotjpg.github.io/hero_realms_counter/)**

A single-file static web app for tracking player health during [Hero Realms](https://www.herorealms.com/) games. No server, no dependencies, no install — just open `index.html` in a browser.

## Features

- **2–6 players** with individual names and starting health
- **Class selection** per player with auto-filled starting HP
- **Pending system** — accumulate damage/healing before committing
- **Undo** — revert the last validated change per player
- **Keyboard shortcuts** for fast play
- **Change history** log per player card
- Health is capped at starting maximum (no over-healing)

## Classes

| Class   | Starting HP |
|---------|-------------|
| Cleric  | 55          |
| Fighter | 60          |
| Ranger  | 58          |
| Thief   | 52          |
| Wizard  | 50          |

## Usage

### Setup screen

1. Pick the number of players (2–6).
2. Optionally set a **default starting health** (used when no class is selected).
3. For each player, enter a name and select a class — or type a custom HP value directly.
4. Click **Begin the Battle**.

### Game screen

Each player card has:

- **−5 / − / + / +5** buttons that add to a **pending** delta (nothing is applied yet).
- A **custom amount** field with **−** and **+** buttons for larger adjustments.
- A **Pending** preview showing the accumulated delta and projected HP once pending is non-zero.
- **✓ Validate** — commits the pending change to the player's HP.
- **✗ Cancel** — discards the pending change without altering HP.
- **↩ Undo** — appears after each validation; reverts the last committed change.

### Keyboard shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` | Cycle focus forward / backward through players |
| `↑` / `↓` | Add +1 / −1 to the focused player's pending |
| `Shift+↑` / `Shift+↓` | Add +5 / −5 to the focused player's pending |
| `Enter` | Validate the focused player's pending |
| `Esc` | Cancel the focused player's pending |

Click any card to focus it. The focused card is highlighted with a gold border and scrolls into view automatically.

## Layout

| Players | Layout |
|---------|--------|
| 2       | 2 columns |
| 3       | 3 columns |
| 4       | 4 columns (compact) |
| 5       | 3 + 2   |
| 6       | 3 + 3   |

## Running

```
open index.html
```

Or drag `index.html` into any modern browser. Works fully offline — no external requests.

## Mobile

The layout is fully responsive and touch-friendly. On small screens the grid adapts to 2 columns, buttons are sized for tap targets, and the keyboard shortcut hint is hidden. Orientation changes are handled automatically. The screen is kept awake via the Wake Lock API while the page is open.

## Persistence

The current game (names, classes, HP, pending deltas, and history) is saved to `localStorage` on every change and restored automatically on page load. Tapping **New Game** clears the saved state.
